    <h2>York Notes on ~me~</h2>
        <p>I usually live in London but am making the most of some long-overdue Edinburgh time at the moment, I write a vegan food and lifestyle blog, I work in the Civil Service, and I know absolutely nothing about coding (for now).</p>

<article>
    <h2>a typical day in lockdown...</h2>
        <p>...is extremely busy. Work, and lots of it, with cooking, baking, spring cleaning, and attempts at home workouts (usually sabotaged by my dog) crammed into every free moment.</p>
